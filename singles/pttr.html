                <p>"Paint The Town Red" was released on August 4, 2023 as the lead single from Doja Cat's upcoming fourth-studio album that 
                    is expected to be released on September 22nd. On the hip-hop and jazz-fused song she samples "Walk On By" by Dionne 
                    Warwick over a smooth beat. She raps about the people who've disliked and hated her for her change in appearance.</p>

                <p>The term, paint the town red, is an expression in American slang which means to go on a reckless debauch or to be wildly 
                    extravagant. This metaphor is used to apply on bonfires which (not literally) paint the sky or scenery red.

                <p>"Paint the Town Red" notably shot to Number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and made Spotify history as the first rap song by a 
                    solo female artist to top the USA Top 50 chart. The song was also credited as the first rap song to hit Number 1 on
                    the Billbord Hot 100 in 2023 â€” marking the first rap Hot 100 No.1 in over a year. This entry ends the longest break
                    for the genre on top of the chart since 2001.</p>
