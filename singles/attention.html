                <p>"Attention" is a promo single, released on June 16, 2023, ahead of Doja Cat's upcoming fourth-studio album that is expected to 
                    be released on September 22, 2023. On the hip-hop and jazz-fused anthem, she embraces herself as she disses the people who've 
                    disliked and hated her for her change in appearance in the public eye.</p>
                    
                <p>The song was initially revealed in April 2023 when Doja shared a tracklist via Instagram of tracks that were being 
                    considered for the new album, one of them being "Attention." Doja did not tease any details about the album again 
                    until May 2023 when she retweeted several tweets mentioning the words "Doja Cat" and "Attention," hinting at the song 
                    being the lead single. On May 9, 2023, she went on Instagram Live and shared a snippet.</p>
                    
                <p>Doja continued teasing the new era with cryptic tweets "Scarlet was Here ðŸ©¸" and "Scarlet's Watching ðŸ©¸," 
                    eventually starting a countdown. The track was officially announced, along with its placeholder cover art, 
                    on June 13, 2023.</p>
