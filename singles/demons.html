                <p>This is Doja Cat's third single to be released from her new album, "Scarlet". It was released with "Paint the Town Red" 
                    as an EP, in addition to the latter's slowed down, sped-up, and instrumental versions. The song, similarly to "Attention" 
                    and "Paint the Town Red", addresses the criticism and insults Doja receives on a daily basis; specifically, the idea that 
                    she's "demonic" or has sold her soul for her fame.</p>

                <p>This song stirred controversy throughout the media, as Doja Cat depicts herself as a demon haunting the house
                    of a family. This led to Doja Cat being accused by many of being a Satanist. In responce to such particular controversies,
                    she has released music that plays into the drama to troll the haters.
                </p>
                    
                <p>Doja confirmed the release to be for September 1, 2023, in an Instagram post, as well as referencing a few of the lyrics 
                    in another post twelve days prior.</p>
